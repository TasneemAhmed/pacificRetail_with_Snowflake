/*
The process_customer_changes procedure is designed to process and integrate customer data changes from a staging layer (bronze.customer_changes_stream) into a refined layer (silver.customer). It follows data validation, transformation, and standardization rules before updating or inserting records.

ðŸ“Œ Key Operations Performed
Merge Customer Data into the Silver Layer (silver.customer)

Uses a MERGE INTO statement to update existing records and insert new records from bronze.customer_changes_stream.
Ensures that customer_id and email are not NULL before processing.
Data Standardization & Validation

1. customer_type Standardization:
    - Converts variations like 'REG', 'R' â†’ 'Regular'
    - Converts variations like 'PREM', 'P' â†’ 'Premium'
    - Defaults to 'Unknown' if the value is unrecognized.
2. age Validation:
    - Only allows ages between 18 and 120.
    - Invalid ages are set to NULL.
3. gender Standardization:
    - Converts variations of 'Male' ('M', 'MALE') â†’ 'Male'
    - Converts variations of 'Female' ('F', 'FEMALE') â†’ 'Female'
    - All other values default to 'Other'.
4. total_purchases Validation:
    Ensures total_purchases is never negative (sets it to 0 if negative).
5.Timestamps:
    - Assigns current_timestamp() to last_updated_timestamp.
6. Merge Logic (MERGE INTO)

    If customer_id exists (WHEN MATCHED), update the record with cleaned data.
    If customer_id doesnâ€™t exist (WHEN NOT MATCHED), insert a new record.
